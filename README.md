# Liveness Detection with Anti-Spoofing

A robust, real-time liveness detection system that verifies the presence of a live person using facial analysis and AI-powered anti-spoofing techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Challenge Liveness Verification**
  - Blink detection
  - Head movement tracking (left/right/up/down)
  - Smile detection
  - Nod detection

- **Advanced Anti-Spoofing**
  - AI-powered spoof detection using MiniFASNetV2
  - Texture analysis to detect screens/prints
  - Motion analysis for natural movement detection
  - 3D face landmark analysis
  - Lighting condition assessment

- **User Experience**
  - Real-time feedback
  - Clear visual instructions
  - Progress indicators
  - Responsive design

## 🛠 Tech Stack

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm 7+ or yarn 1.22+
- Webcam access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MayankJaideep/LivelinessDetection.git
   cd LivelinessDetection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Download the ONNX model:
   - Place `MiniFASNetV2.onnx` in the `public/` directory

## 🎮 Usage

1. Click "Start Verification" to begin
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the liveness challenges
4. The system will analyze your responses and provide a liveness score

## ⚙️ Configuration

Environment variables can be configured in `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_APP_NAME="Liveness Detection"
# Add other configuration as needed
```

## 🏗 Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
